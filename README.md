### Description:
Simple weather app based on pure JavaScript.
A responsive design was developed, that allows to view a weather data on any device.
All displayed data in this application is provided by WeatherBit API. For the today weather, the 'current API' is used, for the rest of days, '16-days API' is used.
This app implements two types of logic: weather forecast based on user input or by user geolocation.
